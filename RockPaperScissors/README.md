# Rock-Paper-Scissors

It is my first project written in JavaScript since 2022.
It is not like I need any of this practice... 
I'm just going step by step with TheOdinProject guide, 
so I don't miss out on anything. 

So the solution is not the best one, the game logic could be shortened with ternary operator,
but it's just simple rock paper scissors, so I don't care if it looks bad (at least for now).
Maybe one day I will come back to this project and make it look amazing ;3
Some 3D stuff would be nice.

For now... I am leaving it as is.

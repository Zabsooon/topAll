# TodoList

Well... this is tragic. I honestly would re-write all off this, because it shouldn't even work,
design patterns used? MAGIC! ON A GOD DAMN EDGE OF RECURSION...

I could make it look good but for what? It shouldn't even work in the first place.
Im abondoning this project and I am moving forward to another one, since approach
to this one was wrong at the start...

C/C++ better ;3
